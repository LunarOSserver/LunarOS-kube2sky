# Mergo

A helper to merge structs and maps in Golang. Useful for configuration default values, avoiding messy if-statements.

Also a lovely [comune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergo) (municipality) in the Province of Ancona in the Italian region Marche.

## Status

It is quick hack to scratch my own itch around how to handle configuration default values. It works fine but it needs a lot more of testing and real world usage.

## Installation

    go get github.com/imdario/mergo

    // use in your .go code
    import (
        "github.com/imdario/mergo"
    )

## Usage

You can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. Also maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).

    if err := mergo.Merge(&dst, src); err != nil {
        // ...
    }

More information and examples in [godoc documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/imdario/mergo).

Note: if test are failing due missing package, please execute:

    go get gopkg.in/yaml.v1
